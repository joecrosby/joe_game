using the HTML below:

<body>
<div class="news-story">

</div>
<div class="news-story">

</div>
</body>

and the following js with a JSON object:

var json = {"items": [
 {
   "title": "sample 1",
   "author": "author 1"
 },
 {
  "title": "sample 2",
  "author": "author 2"
 }
]};

var news = document.getElementsByClassName("news-story")[0];
var items = json.items;
for(var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    var h5 = document.createElement("h5");
    h5.innerHTML = items[i].title;
    news.appendChild(h5);
    var p = document.createElement("p");
    p.innerHTML = items[i].author;
    news.appendChild(p);

}

the following will be output:

(here is the JSON object: {"items": [
                           {
                             "title": "sample 1",
                             "author": "author 1"
                           },
                           {
                            "title": "sample 2",
                            "author": "author 2"
                           }

                           )


sample 1

author 1
sample 2

author 2

if you used JSON data for yours, you would need:

a specification of the JSON data

creation of id's for product prices and so the source of the product return click is known. this will also require refactoring code to allow for passing the product id as a parameter"

eg: product name "lemons" used for button to produce return and button for buying stands is "lemons-stand"

in other words
